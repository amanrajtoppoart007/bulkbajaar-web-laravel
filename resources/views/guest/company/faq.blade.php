                                products. What do I do?</p>

                            <p>Q. Why don&rsquo;t you have a refund policy?</p>
                            <p>Unlike other sites, we are not backed by big financial companies. We are a small startup
                                passionate about providing the best household items at affordable pricing. Our business
                                model does not give us the flexibility to give refunds.&nbsp;</p>
                            <p>Q. What is your exchange policy?</p>
                            <p>We do not have &quot; Money Refund &quot; Policy. Right now our policy allows you to
                                exchange the product you ordered for a different product.&nbsp;</p>

                            <p>We do not have a money refund policy, if you do not like the product and wish to return
                                the product we will pick up the product from your place and once the product reaches our
                                warehouse we will issue you a credit note which can be used to place another order.
                                Since the courier company charges us for the pickup we will have to charge you the same.
                                The pickup fee that the courier charges us and that we will charge you can vary
                                depending upon the number of products you wish to return and your location, the refund
                                amount (after deducting the pickup fee) will be transferred to your account within 7-10
                                days of receiving the product in our warehouse.</p>
